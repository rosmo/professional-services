# Table Access Pattern Analysis
This module consists of deep dive analysis of a BigQuery environment in Google Cloud Platform, according to audt logs - data access data, which can be used to optimise BigQuery usage, and improve time, space and cost of BigQuery.

## Pipeline Optimisation

#### <b>Definitions</b>
The word 'pipeline' refers to a collection of all job instances of a query in the transformation process in a data warehouse, in this case BigQuery. Each 'pipeline' involves source table(s) and destination table. For example, a query:
```
SELECT purchaseId, shop
FROM project.dataset.flash_sale_purchases
WHERE isReturn = TRUE
GROUP BY shop
```
with its destination table set to return_purchases table. The source table of this query is flash_sale_purchases and its destination table is return_purchases table. 

![](assets/pipeline-definition.png)

In the illustriation above, one of the pipeline involves T1 and T2 as its source tables and T5 as its destination table.

Given enough historical data from the audit logs, you can group queries which have the same source table(s) and destination table pair, and see when these were executed. Same source table(s) - destination table pair will almost always come from the same query, even if they are a different query, the semantics should be similar, so this assumption is still valid. After grouping the source table(s) - destination table pair, you might be able to see a pattern in their execution history. You might see that this pair is executed hourly, or daily, or even monthly, and when it was last executed. 

Thus from every source table(s) - destination table pair, we can categorise the pipeline type and the state of it. There are 3 different job types, namely:
<ul>
<li>Live pipelines: Pipelines that run regularly on an obvious schedule, until now
<li>Dead pipelines: Pipelines that used to run regularly on an obvious schedule, but it stopped some time ago
<li>Ad hoc pipelines: Pipelines that does not have a regular scheduling pattern detected, or not enough repetition to conclude that it’s a scheduled live pipeline
</ul>


#### <b>Purpose</b>
This tool helps identify pipeline optimisation points, by pinpointing tables with high difference of writing and reading frequency throughout the data warehouse queries. High discrepancy between the write and read frequency of a table might be a good starting point for identifying optimisation points. Using this tool, we will also be able to visualise the pipelines that are involved with a table of interest, you can then further analyse each of the job of the pipelines, its job type and schedule, and pinpoint problems or optimisations from there. 

![](assets/pipeline-example.gif)

#### <b>Analysing the Result</b>
As can be seen from the GIF, the tool will visualise all the pipelines associated with a table. To be specific, this includes all query jobs that has this table of interest as its source or destination table. As mentioned above, for every query job, there are source table(s) and also a single destination table. 

The tables that are involved in the pipelines associated with a table employs the below logic:

For every query jobs that has the table of interest as one of its source tables or destination table, 
* For every source table(s) of every query job that has the table of itnerest as one of its source table(s), recursively find query jobs that has this source table as its destination table, and get its source table(s). 
* For every destination table of every query job that has the table of interest as its destination table, recursively find query jobs that has destination table as its source table, and get its destination table.

As seen from the GIF too, for every tables that are involved in the pipeline of the table of interest, you can toggle to it, and see the details of the job schedule of every query involving this particular table. It will list down all the query jobs that has this table as its source table, and destination table. These query jobs are then grouped by whether they are ad-hoc jobs, live jobs or dead jobs. For each of this job, the counterpart destination table or source table are also noted.

Given these insights, you can further deep dive into insights that are particularly interesting for you. For example, you might identify imbalance queries, the table `flash_sale_purchases` in your data warehouse might updated hourly but only queried daily. You might also identify queries that are already ‘dead’ and no longer scheduled, according to the last execution time, and identify if this is intended, or something might have happened inside the query that causes an error.

## Architecture
This tool is built on top of BigQuery and Python modules. The data source of the tool is audit log - data access which is located in BigQuery. The module will be responsible for the creation of intermediate tables (from the audit logs - data access source table), and the execution of all relevant queries towards those intermediate tables that will be used for analysis purposes. The analysis can be done through a Jupyter notebook, which can be run locally (if installed) or in AI Platform Notebooks. This guide will specifically be on running the tool on AI Platform Notebooks

</ul>

## Prerequisites
* Your account must have access to read the audit logs - data access table that will be used as a source table for the analysis. For more details regarding different kinds of audit logs, visit this [page](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit#data-access)
* The audit logs - data access table that wwill be used as a source table for the analysis should contain BigQuery logs version 1. For more details regarding audit logs version, visit this [page](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/auditlogs)
* Your account must have access to write to the destination dataset.
* The source and destination dataset must be in the same location

## Set Up
1. Go to the `table-access-pattern-analysis` directory of the project
2. Set the environment variables inside `var.env`.

### Environment Variables
The environment variables that you need to set includes:
* INPUT_PROJECT_ID
* INPUT_DATASET_ID
* INPUT_AUDIT_LOGS_TABLE_ID
* IS_AUDIT_LOGS_INPUT_TABLE_PARTITIONED
* OUTPUT_PROJECT_ID
* OUTPUT_DATASET_ID
* OUTPUT_TABLE_SUFFIX
* LOCATION
* IS_INTERACTIVE_TABLES_MODE

The details of each of the environment variables are as follows:
<ul>
<li><b>INPUT_PROJECT_ID, INPUT_DATASET_ID, INPUT_AUDIT_LOGS_TABLE_ID</b>

<ul>
<li> Definition 

These 3 environment variables should point to the audit logs - data access table that will be the source table of the analysis. The complete path to the audit logs table sourrce will be `INPUT_PROJECT_ID.INPUT_DATASET_ID.INPUT_AUDIT_LOGS_TABLE_ID`. If you want to analyse on a table with a wildcard, include the wildcard in the INPUT_AUDIT_LOGS_TABLE_ID variable as well. 

<li> Example values

* INPUT_PROJECT_ID = 'project-a'
* INPUT_DATASET_ID = 'dataset-b'
* INPUT_AUDIT_LOGS_TABLE_ID = 'cloudaudit_googleapis_com_data_access_*'
</ul>

<li><b>OUTPUT_PROJECT_ID, OUTPUT_DATASET_ID</b>
<ul>
<li> Definition 

These 2 environment variables should point to the dataset ID that will contain all the tables and routines that is going to be created during the analysis.

<li> Example values

* OUTPUT_PROJECT_ID = 'project-c'
* OUTPUT_DATASET_ID = 'dataset-d'

</ul>

<li><b>OUTPUT_TABLE_SUFFIX</b>
<ul>
<li> Definition 

The 'OUTPUT_TABLE_SUFFIX' variable is used to denote an 'analysis environment' that you intend to build. All tables that are produced by this run will have this variable as its suffix, thus it will not replace any existing tables that you have created for other analysis. 

If this variable is not set, the analysis cannot be run as you might unintentionally forgot to change the suffix and replace an existing set of tables with the same suffix set. 
<li> Example value

* OUTPUT_TABLE_SUFFIX = 'first-analysis'. 
</ul>

<li><b>IS_AUDIT_LOGS_INPUT_TABLE_PARTITIONED</b>
<ul>
<li> Definition 

The 'IS_AUDIT_LOGS_INPUT_TABLE_PARTITIONED' variable is a boolean value which denotes whether the input audit log table is a partitioned table. 

<li> Value

Its value should be either "TRUE" or "FALSE", with the exact casing. 
</ul>

<li><b>LOCATION</b>

<ul>
<li> Definition 

The 'LOCATION' variable is used to specify the region on which the input dataset and output dataset is located, a common and most used location is 'US'.

<li> Example value
    
* LOCATION=US
</ul>

<li><b>IS_INTERACTIVE_TABLES_MODE</b>
<ul>
<li> Definition

Boolean on whether you want the tables to be interactive, it is recommended to set this to "TRUE". If you want the tables output to be interactive, you should set this value to "TRUE" and can choose to run the Classic Jupyter Notebook. To do this, 
    1. Navigate to `Help` menu in Jupyter
    2. Click on `Launch Classic Notebook`. 

The output of the tables produced by this notebook will be interactive (can filter, sort, search), but it is an older version of Jupyter notebook in AI Platform Notebooks.
    
If you want the tables output to not be interactive, you can set this value to "FALSE" and run it as normal but the table is not as interactive.
    
<li> Value

Its value should be either "TRUE" or "FALSE", with the exact casing.

</ul>
</ul>

### Caveats
After resetting any environment variables, you need to restart the kernel because otherwise it will not be loaded by Jupyter. To restart, go to the menu 'Kernel' and choose 'Restart'

## Analysis
1. Open a notebook to run an analysis.
2. You can choose the interactivity mode of the output.
    * If you want the tables output to be interactive, you can choose to run the Classic Jupyter Notebook. To do this, navigate to `Help` menu, then `Launch Classic Jupyter Notebook`. The output of the tables produced by this notebook will be interactive (can filter, sort, search), but it is an older version of Jupyter notebook in AI Platform Notebooks
    * If you prefer a newer version of the Jupyter notebook, you can choose to not run the classic Jupyter notebook. The output of the tables produced by this notebook is not interactive.
2. Run the cells from top to bottom of the notebook. 
3. In the first cell, there is a datetime picker, which is used to filter the audit logs data source to the start and end date range specified. If you select `05-05-2021` as a start date and `06-05-2021`, the analysis result of the notebook run will be based on audit logs data on 5th May 2021 to 6th May 2021.
4. Run pipeline optimisation analysis produced in Jupyter Notebook
    <ul>
    <li><b>Pipeline Optimisation, run `pipeline.ipynb`</b>

    This tool helps identify pipeline optimisation points. At first, the tool will list down tables with high difference of writing and reading frequency throughout the data warehouse queries. 

    After identifying the table that you would like to analyse further, you can select the table in the next part of the notebook and display the result in an iFrame inside the notebook. 
    </ul>

## Appendix
### Intermediate Tables Creation
As mentioned in the [Architecture](#architecture) section, this module involves the creation of intermediate tables. These are important and relevant for users that are interested to analyse the insights generated from this tool even further. The schema and details of each intermediate tables created are explained below. 

#### Pipeline Optimisation

There are 4 intermediate tables created for pipeline optimisation analysis
<ul>
<li> job_info_with_tables_info<OUTPUT_TABLE_SUFFIX>

This table stores some of the details of job history that are relevant to pipeline optimisation. Each job history entry corresponds to a single entry in the audit logs. The audit logs are filtered to the ones that are relevant for pipeline optimisation.

### Routines Creation
There are several JavaScript UDFs created in BigQuery upon usage of the tool. These function files are not to be run independently in a JS environment, these file contents will be loaded by the Python package, `src/` to be constructed as a funciton creation query to BigQuery.

<ul> 

<li>getPipelineTypeAndSchedule

This funtion takes in an array of timestamp, and return a struct of the pipeline type and schedule according to the history. There are 3 possible values for pipeline type: live/dead/adhoc, and there are 4 possible values for schedule: non deterministic/hourly/daily/monthly. 

The routine file content is located in `bq_routines/getPipelineTypeAndSchedule.js`

<li>getTablesInvolvedInPipelineOfTable

This function returns a list of tables that are involved in the pipeline of the table of input.

The routine file content is located in`bq_routines/getTablesInvolvedInPipelineOfTable.js`

</ul>
